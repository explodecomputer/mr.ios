\title{Calculate index of suspicion}
\usage{
ios(exposure_dat, background_dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposure_dat}{Instruments for the exposure, obtained using \code{extract_instruments}}

\item{background_dat}{Effects for the instruments on a set of variables, used to calculate index of suspicion}
}
\value{
Data.frame
}
\description{
If a SNP influences multiple other traits then it could be 'suspicious', and more likely to be pleiotropic. This function implements two basic approaches to estimate IOS
}
\details{
- ios1: A summary of the SNP r2 with the other traits (r2_gu)
- ios2: A summary of the ratio of r2_gu / r2_gx, where r2_gx is the variance explained by the SNP on the exposure. Estimates the index of suspicion, whereupon SNPs which have a larger effect on a set of traits given their effect on the exposure are deemed more suspicious

Summarising across multiple traits can be dune using mean, sd, iqr, median, 95% value, maximum value
